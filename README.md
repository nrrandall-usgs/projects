# projects

Included in this directory are:  
 
. The Jupyter Notebook 1140_exo_make_press_ac.ipynb walks through the steps of how to create a pressure-corrected dataset (in this case it produces 1140solo3db-cal.nc)  
. atm_pressure_compare.ipynb compares the atmospheric data from the sensor we deployed at the field site on Pea Island with data from NOAA Tides and Currents sites near Pea Island  
. glob_att1140.txt is an example Global Attribute file, which is informational, and used in clipping the atmospherically corrected data file, based on Deployment and Recovery dates  
. Weather station data from Oregon Inlet, used in determining the atmospheric pressure correction, from the NOAA Tides and Currents site (OregonIn.csv)  
. rbr_upbeach_compare.ipynb compares data from the three pressure sensors that were covered by water during the experiment  
. solo3d1140_config.yaml is a configuration file used alonside glob_att1140.txt for the pressure correction  

The datafiles relevent to this project are saved on the WHSC network.
